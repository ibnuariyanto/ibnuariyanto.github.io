  abstract  = "Background/Objectives: Elevated cytokine levels, including IL-6
               and IL-1β, can contribute to persistent brain inflammation in
               children with autism and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,
               exacerbating autism-related behaviours and symptoms. This study
               evaluates the impact of CMV-induced cytokine increases on the
               eating behaviours and sensory profiles of children with autism.
               Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed, involving
               children aged two to five years (CMV-reactive IgG), with ASD (n=
               98) and TD (n = 96). Serological tests using ELISA were conducted
               to measure IgG CMV, IL-6, and IL-1β biomarkers. Eating behaviours
               were evaluated using the BAMBI (Brief Autism Mealtime Behaviour
               Inventory), and sensory profiles were assessed using the SSP
               (Short Sensory Profile). Statistical analyses were performed
               using Spearman’s rank and chi-square tests. Results: The results
               show that autism significantly affects children’s eating
               behaviours and sensory profiles (p < 0.001), with notable
               differences found between the groups. Correlation analysis
               revealed a significant association between IgG CMV and IL-6 (p =
               0.026) and IL-1β (p = 0.014) in the ASD group. Additionally,
               eating behaviours (food refusal and limited variety) in ASD
               correlated with IL-6 and IL-1β. Sensory characteristics, such as
               tactile sensitivity, were found to correlate with IL-6 (p =
               0.027) and IL-1β (p = 0.002) in the ASD group. Conclusions: These
               findings suggest that CMV-infected children with autism are at
               increased risk of IL-6 and IL-1β dysregulation, contributing to
               sensory processing issues and eating behaviours. Further research
               is needed to enhance CMV testing protocols and better understand
               the virus’s role in the development of sensory and behavioural
               issues in children with autism.",

               donor were infected with DENV-1 and treated with C. alata at 2 ×
               IC50. mRNAs expression was measured by real-time PCR at two time
               points: 2 and 24 hours post-treatment. The results showed that
               the expression of NFκB remained relatively constant between 2 and

               3.519, and 0.445 fold, respectively. At 24 hours, NFκB expression
               was slightly down-regulated, while TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 were
               slightly up-regulated. The mRNA expression changes were not
               statistically significant, but the results showed that the effect

               PLWH is plausible. Atherosclerosis has also been linked with γδ T
               cells and CMV seropositivity with altered γδ T cell profiles in
               other populations. In our cohort of PLWH starting ART in Jakarta
               (Indonesia), metrics of the CMV burden correlated with altered

               PLWH began ART. γδ T cell subsets were immunophenotyped using
               flow cytometry, and CMV-reactive antibodies were quantitated by
               ELISA after fixed intervals on ART. Carotid intima-media
               thickness (cIMT) was used to assess atherosclerosis. PLWH
               retained higher levels of CMV-reactive antibody than healthy
               controls (p = 0.001-0.04), and 50\% began ART with detectable CMV
               DNA. cIMT values rose between 6 and 12 months on ART. At 6
               months, cIMT correlated with CMV-reactive antibodies and
               proportions of activated Vδ2- γδ T cells (r = 0.56-0.57; p =
               0.035-0.042) in PLWH who began ART with detectable CMV DNA.
               Hence, a high burden of replicating CMV may promote
               atherosclerosis in PLWH after a period on ART, and the role of
               activated Vδ2- γδ T cells warrants further study.",

               been demonstrated for people living with HIV (PLHIV). However,
               vaccine studies in PLHIV are limited, and there is a gap in which
               vaccine type provides the best response in PLHIV. Thus, PLHIV may
               benefit from mRNA vaccine types compared to inactivated vaccines.
               This study aims to assess the immune responses to vaccination by
               measuring specific antibodies (IgG) targeting the receptor
               binding sites (RBDs) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the levels of
               IL-2 and IFN-γ in plasma. A total of 41 PLHIV who regularly take
               antiretroviral therapy (ART) over a period of six months, along
               with 31 individuals in a healthy control group (HC), were
               administered either two mRNA or inactivated vaccines. Data
               regarding demographics and clinical information were gathered
               from the medical records. An analysis was conducted on the
               neutralisation antibody IgG specific to RBD using the
               chemiluminescence microparticle assay (CMIA). The levels of IL-2
               and IFN-γ were quantified using the Luminex assay method from
               plasma samples. Data were collected in the laboratory 28 days
               after each vaccination. After the first vaccination, the level of
               anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG was higher in PLHIV who received the mRNA
               vaccines than those who received inactivated vaccines (p =
               0.006). The levels of mRNA in the PLHIV group showed a
               significant correlation with IL-2 and IFN-γ after the second
               vaccination (r = 0.51, p = 0.0035; r = 0.68, p = 0.002). The
               group of PLHIV who received the inactivated vaccine showed
               increased IL-2 and IFN-γ after the initial vaccination, compared
               to PLHIV who received the mRNA vaccine (p = 0.04; p = 0.08).
               Administering a two-dose vaccination is essential to increase the
               levels of neutralising antibodies significantly (p = 0.013) in
               PLHIV who have received inactivated vaccines; further study is

               counts. PLHIV showed higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and
               increased IL-2 and IFN-γ levels. Our study encourages SARS-CoV-2
               vaccination in PLHIV regardless of its CD4 cell counts.
               Furthermore, the mRNA vaccine may give robust high antibody
               responses in PLHIV.",

               adults beginning ART in an inner-city clinic in Jakarta,

               to 48) years] were enrolled in the JakCCANDO Project.
               Echocardiography and carotid Doppler ultrasonography were
               performed before ART (V0) and after 3, 6, and 12 months (V3-12).
               Antibodies reactive with CMV lysate or IE-1 protein were assessed
               at each timepoint and CMV DNA was identified at V0. RESULTS:
               Markers of adverse cardiovascular prognosis [left ventricular
               mass index, ejection fraction and carotid intimal media thickness
               (cIMT)] were similar to healthy controls, but increased at V12.
               Internal diameters of the carotid arteries and systolic blood
               pressure correlated with HIV disease severity at V0, but cardiac
               parameters and cIMT did not. E/A ratios (left ventricular
               diastolic function) were lower in patients with CMV DNA at V0,
               but this effect waned by V6. Levels of antibody reactive with CMV
               IE-1 correlated inversely with CD4 T cell counts at V0, and
               levels at V6-V12 correlated directly with the right cIMT.
               CONCLUSIONS: Overall the severity of HIV disease and the response
               to ART have only subtle effects on cardiovascular health in this
               young Asian population. CMV replication before ART may have a
               transient effect on cardiac health, whilst antibody reactive with
               CMV IE-1 may mark a high persistent CMV burden with cumulative
               effects on the carotid artery.",

               common in HIV+ individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy
               (ART), even though neurotoxic antiretroviral drugs (e.g.
               stavudine) have been phased out of use. Accumulating evidence
               indicates that the neuropathy is immune-mediated. We hypothesize
               that chemokines produced locally in the skin promote migration of
               macrophages and T cells into the tissue, damaging cutaneous
               nerves causing HIV-SN. DESIGN: We assessed chemokine receptor
               expression on infiltrating CD14 and CD3 cells around cutaneous
               nerves in standardized skin biopsies from HIV-SN+ patients (n =
               5), HIV-SN- patients (n = 9) and healthy controls (n = 4).
               METHODS: The AIDS Clinical Trials Group Brief Peripheral
               Neuropathy Screen was used to assess Indonesian HIV+ patients
               receiving ART without stavudine (case definition: bilateral
               presence of at least one symptom and at least one sign of
               neuropathy). Distal leg skin biopsies were stained to visualize
               chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR5, CXCR3, CXCR4, CX3CR1),
               infiltrating CD3 and CD14 cells, and protein-gene-product 9.5 on
               nerves, using immunohistochemistry and 4-colour confocal
               microscopy. RESULTS: Intraepidermal nerve fibre density was
               variable in patients without HIV-SN and generally lower in those
               with HIV-SN. CX3CR1 was more evident on CD14 cells whereas CCR2,
               CCR5, CXCR3 and CXCR4 were more common on CD3 cells. Expression
               of CX3CR1, CCR2 and CCR5 was more common in HIV-SN+ patients than
               those without HIV-SN. CXCR3 and CXCR4 were upregulated in all
               HIV+ patients, compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSION:
               Inflammatory macrophages expressing CX3CR1 and T cells expressing
               CCR2 and CCR5 may participate in peripheral nerve damage leading
               to HIV-SN in HIV+ patients treated without stavudine. Further

               CMV antibodies, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP],

               assessed before ART (V0) and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months

               antibodies were measured in plasma before ART (baseline), and
               after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. CMV DNA was sought in blood
               granulocytes at baseline by quantitative PCR assay and a deletion
               in the NKG2C gene was identified by PCR. NK cell profiles were
               monitored by flow cytometry in 19 patients stratified by the
               presence of CMV DNA. Healthy controls (n = 17) were assessed

               on NK cells. A dramatic elevation in cells expressing NKG2C was

               Indonesia, with a median (range) age of 31 (19-48) years. RAC was
               assessed using Image J software from fundus photos of both eyes,
               before ART (V0) and after 3-12 months (V3-V12). CMV DNA and

               HIV patients had narrower retinal arteries and higher levels of
               CMV antibodies than healthy controls. RAC decreased over 12
               months of ART (p < .0001). Right RAC correlated with CMV IE-1

               BDNF to the medium induced rBMMSCs into neurons and glial cells,
               but the conditions were not optimal for rATMSC as judged by the

               10)*C] has been linked with several immunopathological conditions
               and with rapid progression of HIV disease. Reported associations
               with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in HIV patients before or
               during early antiretroviral therapy (ART) may therefore reflect
               greater replication of CMV in advanced HIV disease or an
               immunopathological response to CMV in the retina. OBJECTIVE: As
               all Indonesian HIV patients display high levels of CMV
               replication, we evaluated whether TNF block genotypes alter
               markers of their burden of CMV and/or associate with retinitis.
               METHODS: We assessed 79 consecutive HIV patients beginning ART,
               25 HIV patients with a history of CMV-retinitis and 63 healthy
               adults. HIV RNA, CD4 T-cell counts, CMV-reactive antibody and CMV
               DNA were measured and alleles of TNFA-308, BAT1(intron 10) and
               TNFA-1031 (rs1799964) were determined. RESULTS: TNFA-308 and
               BAT1(intron 10) were in complete linkage disequilibrium. Patients
               carrying minor alleles at both loci had higher levels of
               CMV-reactive antibody after one month on ART (p=0.01), but not at
               other time points spanning 1 year on ART. 50\% of patients had
               detectable CMV DNA before ART, irrespective of TNF block
               genotypes. However, the TNFA-308*A/- BAT1(intron 10)*C haplotype
               was more common in CMV-retinitis patients than other patients or
               healthy controls (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The TNFA-308*A/BAT1(intron
               10)*C haplotype appears to affect CMV-induced pathology rather
               than CMV replication.",

               ∼80\% of the world's population. Acute infections are
               asymptomatic in healthy individuals but generate diverse
               syndromes in neonates, solid organ transplant recipients, and
               HIV-infected individuals. The HCMV gene US28 encodes a homolog of
               a human chemokine receptor that is able to bind several
               chemokines and HIV gp120. Deep sequencing technologies were used
               to sequence US28 directly from 60 clinical samples from
               Indonesian HIV patients and Australian renal transplant
               recipients, healthy adults, and neonates. Molecular modeling
               approaches were used to predict whether nine nonsynonymous
               mutations in US28 may alter protein binding to a panel of six
               chemokines and two variants of HIV gp120. Ninety-two percent of
               samples contained more than one variant of HCMV, as defined by at
               least one nonsynonymous mutation. Carriage of these variants
               differed between neonates and adults, Australian and Indonesian
               samples, and saliva samples and blood leukocytes. Two
               nonsynonymous mutations (N170D and R267K) were associated with
               increased levels of immediate early protein 1 (IE-1) and
               glycoprotein B (gB) HCMV-reactive antibodies, suggesting a higher
               viral burden. Seven of the nine mutations were predicted to alter
               binding of at least one ligand. Overall, HCMV variants are common
               in all populations and have the potential to affect US28
               interactions with human chemokines and/or gp120 and alter
               responses to the virus. The findings relied on deep sequencing
               technologies applied directly to clinical samples, so the
               variants exist in vivo. IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)
               is a common viral pathogen of solid organ transplant recipients,
               neonates, and HIV-infected individuals. HCMV encodes homologs of
               several host genes with the potential to influence viral
               persistence and/or pathogenesis. Here, we present deep sequencing
               of an HCMV chemokine receptor homolog, US28, acquired directly
               from clinical specimens. Carriage of these variants differed
               between patient groups and was associated with different levels
               of circulating HCMV-reactive antibodies. These features are
               consistent with a role for US28 in HCMV persistence and
               pathogenesis. This was supported by in silico analyses of the
               variant sequences demonstrating altered ligand-binding profiles.
               The data delineate a novel approach to understanding the
               pathogenesis of HCMV and may impact the development of an
               effective vaccine.",

               RAC was associated with carriage of allele 2 at IL1A+4845
               (p=0.037 after 12 months on ART).Conclusion: Overall the
               paradoxical reduction in the RAC in HIV patients responding to
               ART was not modified by genotypes known to affect NK cell
               function or TNF responses, but IL1A genotype may modify the
               decline in the right RAC.Keywords: anti-retroviral therapy, CMV,

               influenced by the neurocognitive domain tested, the severity of
               HIV disease, and by education. In young adult patients commencing
               ART in Jakarta, Indonesia, we described improvements in all
               cognitive domains except memory after 6-12 months on ART. In this
               study, we address relationships between cytomegalovirus (CMV), γδ
               T cell profiles and neurocognitive assessments with a focus on
               memory. The JakCCANDO (Jakarta CMV Cardiovascular ART Neurology
               Dentistry Ophthalmology) project recruited patients (aged 18-48
               years) beginning ART with <200 CD4+ T cells/μL. Cognitive
               assessments used validated tests of five domains. Flow cytometry
               was used to assess proportions of Vδ2- and Vδ2+ γδ T cells, and
               their activation (HLA-DR) and terminal differentiation
               (CD27-/CD45RA+). All patients carried high levels of antibodies
               reactive with CMV, so the detection of CMV DNA before ART was
               used to stratify participants into subgroups with a moderate/high
               or an extremely high burden of CMV. Patients had higher
               proportions of Vδ2- γδ T cells and fewer Vδ2+ γδ T cells than
               healthy controls before ART and at 6 months. Z-scores for memory
               function correlated with proportions of Vδ2+ γδ T cells at both
               time points. Linear regression analyses confirmed this
               association. When the detection of CMV DNA was used to stratify

               cells or CMV antibodies was only discernible in patients with a

               patients treated in Indonesia. STUDY DESIGN: HIV-infected adults
               (n = 32) were examined when they began antiretroviral therapy
               (ART) with < 200 CD4 T-cells/µl (V0) and after 60 months (V60).
               Age-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 32) were assessed once.
               METHODS: Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD) was assessed by
               ultrasound on brachial arteries at V60 and in HC. Plasma markers
               of immune activation and endothelial activation, and CMV
               antibodies (lysate, gB, IE-1) were assessed in all samples.
               Results were assessed using bivariate (non-parametric) and
               multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Levels of inflammatory
               biomarkers and CMV antibodies declined on ART, but the antibodies
               remained higher than in HC. FMD values were similar in patients
               and HC at V60. In HIV patients, levels of CMV lysate antibody
               correlated inversely (r = - 0.37) with FMD. The optimal model
               predicting lower FMD values (adjusted R2 = 0.214, p = 0.012)
               included CMV lysate antibodies and chondroitin sulphate. In HC,

               individuals are seronegative. However, effects of CMV are unclear
               in HIV patients who all have high levels of CMV antibodies. Other
               metrics of their CMV burden are needed. Amongst transplant
               recipients, CMV drives the expansion of NK cell populations
               expressing NKG2C and/or LIR1 and lacking FcRγ. METHODS:
               Indonesian HIV patients (n = 40) were tested before ART and after
               6 months, with healthy local controls (n = 20). All patients had
               high CMV antibody titres. 52\% started therapy with CMV DNA
               detectable by qPCR, providing a crude measure of CMV burden.
               Proportions of CD56Hi or CD56Lo NK cells expressing FcRγ, NKG2C
               or LIR1 were determined flow cytometrically. CVD was predicted
               using carotid intimal media thickness (cIMT). Values were
               correlated with levels of CMV antibodies on ART. RESULTS:
               Patients had low proportions of CD56Lo and more CD56Hi NK cells.
               However proportions of FcRγ- NK cells were lowest in patients
               with CMV DNA, and cIMT values related inversely with FcRγ- NK
               cells in these patients. Percentages of NKG2C+CD56Lo NK cells
               were similar in patients and controls, but rose in patients with
               CMV DNA. Proportions of NKG2C+ CD56Hi NK cells correlated with
               levels of CMV antibodies in CMV DNA-negative patients.
               CONCLUSIONS: We show that the very high burdens of CMV in this
               population confound systems developed to study effects of CMV in
               other populations. FcRγ- NK cells may be depleted by very high
               CMV burdens, but NKG2C and antibody levels may be informative in
               patients on ART.",
