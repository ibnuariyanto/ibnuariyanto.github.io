## Research Projects
## Ongoing

### CAR-NK Project

Initial development of artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC) for Natural killer cell expansion, the acceleration of the first CAR-NK cells in Indonesia
The project is a collaboration study with Prof. Alex Mc Lellan from the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Otago University, New Zealand. I have gotten a small grant from DIPI to start the project in the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia. My supervisor from UI is dr. Rina la Distia Nora, Sp.M(K)., PhD & Fithriyah, PhD.
**Grant Website:** [https://dipi.id/awarded-proposal-dipis-small-research-grant-2024/](https://dipi.id/awarded-proposal-dipis-small-research-grant-2024/). (ongoing)

### Immunology of HIV Patients

The collaborative research between Universitas Indonesia and Curtin University on Cytomegalovirus co-infection in HIV patients. We have discovered the role of several immune cells linked with clinical outcomes:

- CD4 and CD8 T-cells
- Natural killer cells
- Gamma Delta T cells (ongoing)

### Cytomegalovirus

The CMV research has been done in HIV patients starting ART, followed by 5 years in the JakCCANDO Study.

Currently working with Biomedical Science UI PhD student Isti Anindya to understand CMV's role in the cognitive development of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) children (the principal investigator was Prof. Amin Subandrio). (ongoing)

We have been investigating CMV IL10 and human IL10R SNPs with Curtin/UWA Researcher Shelley Waters. The research also part of the Master Research of Yudha Fariska (master Student of Biomedical Science) (ongoing)

### Molecular Viability Assay of Mycobacterium lepra

I am co-supervisor of Clara Imaniar (master Student of Biomedical Science). The main supervisor is Prof Yeva Rosana (Dept. Microbiology FMUI). Our main goal is to develop a molecular method to identify live M. lepra from clinical samples. (ongoing)

### Non Tuberculosis Mycobacterium Genomic

I am particiapting in the NTM Genomic project with Prof. Anis Karuniawati as PI from Dept. Clinical Microbiology FMUI in collaborating with Osaka University. I have work with nanopore sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. 

### Clinical trial participation
I am working with Integrated Laboratory Universitas Indonesia for immunology analysis of TB Vaccine candidates clinical Trial in Indonesia

## Finished

### COINCIDE Project (2024-2025)

I am participating in the COINCIDE Project. Working under the Prof. Anis Karuniawati Project, I am collaborating with Soe You Naing - Utrecht University. The project involves microbiology specialist student dr.Lili. (end on April)

### Vaccine Development (2021-2023)

I am working with a Master's student in biomedical science at the Faculty of Medicine (Raisha Muhayya), Universitas Indonesia. Her work is to develop recombinant SARS-CoV-2 vaccine construction. The vaccine design used a bioinformatic approach to predict the optimal epitope for T-cell response. (end)

### Infectious Diseases Molecular Diagnostics Development (2021-2022)

Work with a private company to validate qPCR kits (end)
